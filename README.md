16 different measurements are available for each sample. namely dataset has 16 features: 
Area,Perimeter,MajorAxisLength,MinorAxisLength,AspectRation,	Eccentricity,ConvexArea,EquivDiameter,Extent,Solidity,	roundness,Compactness,ShapeFactor1,	ShapeFactor2,	ShapeFactor3,ShapeFactor4	
all features are numeric values.
the dataset is in csv form and the last column is class labels.
